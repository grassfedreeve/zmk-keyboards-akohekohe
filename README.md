# ʻākohekohe ZMK Module

This repository contains the shield files for the ['ākohekohe](https://github.com/grassfedreeve/akohekohe/) to allow users to build firmware. This can be done by adding the module to the west.yml found in your zmk-config's config directory. There is a full guide available for this here: [ZMK Modules Doc](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules)

## Usage

1. Edit your west.yml file found in your zmk-config's config directory to add the akohekohe module:

```

```
2. 

# Default Keymap

The default keymap is provided in the module, here is a visual guide made using caksoylar's great [keymap-drawer](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer)

# Extra Notes 

I would highly recommend anyone using bluetooth enable caksoylar's [zmk-rgbled-widget](https://github.com/caksoylar/zmk-rgbled-widget), which is so fantastic that anyone using a xiao ble should use it.
